Ulster Worldly is a blog about the history of presbyterianism.

I am a deacon in the [Orthodox Presbyterian Church](https://shilohopc.org) and an arm-chair church historian. This site started with me making a digital archive of the writings of my [grandfather and great grandfather](https://ulsterworldly.com/hoppers/) who were PCUS (Southern Presbyterian) missionaries to Korea.

I am fascinated by American religious history broadly, and I am also particularly interested in the [presbyterian controversy](https://ulsterworldly.com/presbyterian-conflict/) of the early 20th century.

The name "Ulster Worldly" is a silly combination of "other worldly" (in recognition that this world is not our home) and Ulster (for the Ulster Plantation in northern Ireland where many of my ancestors came from).
