Ulster Worldly is a blog about the history of presbyterianism.

I am a deacon in the [Orthodox Presbyterian Church](https://shilohopc.org) and an arm-chair church historian. This site started with me making a digital archive of the writings of my [grandfather and great grandfather](https://ulsterworldly.com/hoppers/) who were PCUS (Southern Presbyterian) missionaries to Korea.

I am fascinated by American religious history broadly, and I am also particularly interested in the [presbyterian controversy](https://ulsterworldly.com/presbyterian-conflict/) of the early 20th century.

I have [a number of other websites](http://ulsterworldly.com/resources) for building up the body of Christ.
