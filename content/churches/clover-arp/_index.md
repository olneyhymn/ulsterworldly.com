From the 1903 [Centenial History of the ARP](https://books.google.com/books?id=eco5AQAAMAAJ):

> Clover is situated in York Co., S. C., about ten miles from Yorkville, the county seat, on the line of the Carolina and Northwestern Railway. The church was organized May 24th, 1893. For some time previous to the organization, Rev. R. M. Stevenson preached there one night in each month, and after the organization, Mr. Stevenson was called as pastor for one fourth his time, and was installed Nov. 23rd, 1893, and still continues as the pastor. Soon after the organization the people built a neat house of worship.
