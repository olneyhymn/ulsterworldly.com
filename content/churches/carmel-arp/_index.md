From the 1903 [Centenial History of the ARP](https://books.google.com/books?id=eco5AQAAMAAJ):

> Carmel, York Co., S. C., appears on the roll of the Associate Presbytery of the Carolinas before 1811, Rev. Wm. Dixon preached there from its organization probably until near his death. In a sketch of Sharon congregation by the Rev. R. A. Ross, D. D., it is said that, in the latter part of 1796 or the beginning of 1797. Sharon united with Bethany in the northern part of York Co., and with Carmel in the South, in a call to Rev. Wm. Dixon then recently come from Scotland, which call he accepted. In the same sketch it is said that, in 1826, Sharon, Tirzah and Carmel Hill united in a call to Rev. W. M. McElwee which he accepted. It disappears from the roll some time in the [18]30â€™s.
