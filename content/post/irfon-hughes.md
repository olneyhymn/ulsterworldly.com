Yesterday, I sat down with my dear friend and former pastor Irfon Hughes to discuss his life and minstry. Pastor Hughes was born in 1942 in Wales and served as a minister for 50 years in 6 congregations in Wales, England, and the United States. Most recently, he was pastor of my church Shiloh Presbyterian Church (OPC) in Raleigh, NC. The interview is split up into two parts, roughly consisting of his ministry in the UK in the first part and in the US in the second part. I hope you enjoy hearing about how the Lord used this man for so many years.
