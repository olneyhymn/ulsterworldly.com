My grandfather was born in May 17, 1921 in Kwangju, Korea; he was the perfect age to have served in the Second Wold War, but the draft board gave him an exception because he'd been taken under care of the Concord Presbytery of the PCUS in fall 1939; he was told to continue his studies at Davidson College.

Here is his draft registration card from 1941:

Notably his "person who will always know your address" was Dr. C. Darby Fulton, Executive Secretary of Foreign Missions of the PCUS. [Fulton](http://www.thisday.pcahistory.org/2013/09/september-5-c-darby-fulton/), a missionary kid himself, had served as a missionary to Japan and preached at my grandfather's baptism service on June 26, 1921. We would serve as the Executive Secretary from 1932 to 1961.
