On August 2, 1936, [Stanford Presbyterian Church](https://www.stanfordpresbyterian.org) in Stanford, Kentucky celebrated "Hopper Day," honoring the children of George Dunlap Hopper. The program featured three of his children who had entered ministry:

**Rev. W. H. Hopper, D.D.** ([William Higgins Hopper](/post/siblings-of-joseph-hopper/)), pastor at Burnside, Kentucky, delivered the sermon and benediction.

**Rev. Joseph Hopper**, my great-grandfather and [PCUS missionary to Korea](/people/joseph-hopper/), read the Scripture and led in prayer. This was during his family's furlough year, shortly before they would [return to Korea](https://ulsterworldly.com/post/a-trip-around-the-world/) after their trip around the world in 1935.

**Miss Margaret Hopper**, Joseph's sister and [missionary in Mokpo, Korea](/post/siblings-of-joseph-hopper/), conducted the vespers service with Mrs. W. O. Martin serving as organist.

My grandfather, Joe B. Hopper, who was fifteen at the time, [later recalled](https://ulsterworldly.com/post/siblings-of-joseph-hopper/) attending this service and noting that "the three uncles were sitting in the front pew with backs to the congregation, and it was amusing to note that all three were completely (and similarly) bald."

The day included morning worship, lunch at the church, and evening vespers.
