I've run the Twitter account [@pres_history](https://twitter.com/pres_history) for the last 5 years. I mostly use it to tweet posts from 
[Today in OPC History](https://opc.org/today.html) and [This Day in Presbyterian History](https://opc.org/today.html), but I occasionally 
share other things I'm discovering and questions I'm asking. 

Since Twitter tends to be ephimeral, I compiled a list of question I've asked over the last 3 years; most of them I still don't have answers for.
