Over the past few months I've been collecting the full text of J. Gresham Machen's libertarian letters to the editor—a fascinating window into how his Reformed theology shaped his political views during the 1920s and early 1930s.

These weren't merely political opinions. For Machen, liberty was a theological principle. He believed government power threatened both individual conscience and the church's spiritual independence. As historian Bradley J. Birzer [has noted](https://fee.org/articles/j-gresham-machen-a-forgotten-libertarian/), Machen "feared the expansion of federal power" because he saw it as "a threat to human dignity, individual liberty, and Christian faith itself."

The collection spans a critical decade in Machen's life: from his battles at Princeton Seminary against theological liberalism in the early 1920s, through the fundamentalist-modernist controversy and the formation of Westminster Seminary in 1929, to the final years before his suspension from the PCUSA ministry. During these same years when he was fighting modernism in the church, he was equally engaged fighting statism in the public square.

The letters reveal consistent themes:

- [Urging repeal of New York's Lusk anti-sedition laws](https://www.readmachen.com/article/1923/urging-repeal-of-lusk-anti-sedition-laws/) (1923)
- [Opposing a federal department of education](https://www.readmachen.com/article/1926/shall-we-have-a-federal-department-of-education/) (1926)—perhaps his most famous letter, arguing such a department would create "a tyranny over the mind"
- [Against the proposed child labor amendment](https://www.readmachen.com/article/1924/child-labor-and-liberty/) (1924), which he saw as dangerous federal intrusion into family life
- [Opposing alien enrollment requirements](https://www.readmachen.com/article/1925/against-alien-enrollment/) (1925)
- [Protesting compulsory fingerprinting](https://www.readmachen.com/article/1933/against-fingerprinting/) and [registration](https://www.readmachen.com/article/1933/compulsory-registration/) schemes (1933)

What's striking is how Machen's opposition to theological liberalism in the church and political liberalism (in the progressive sense) in the state flowed from the same source. Both represented human institutions claiming authority that belonged only to God—the church claiming it could redefine Christian doctrine, the state claiming it could control education and conscience. As ITR Foundation [observes](https://itrfoundation.org/in-the-fight-against-liberalism-remember-j-gresham-machen/), Machen understood that "the same basic error underlies both ecclesiastical and political tyranny."

For those of us interested in the intersection of Reformed theology and political philosophy, these letters remain remarkably relevant. They demonstrate that confessional Presbyterianism has always had something important to say about the limits of state power—not despite its theology, but precisely because of it.
