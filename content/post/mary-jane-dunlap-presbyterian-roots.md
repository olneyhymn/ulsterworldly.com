The Hopper family's journey from frontier Baptist preachers to Presbyterian missionaries spans four generations and hinges on a single marriage: Joseph Hopper's union with Mary Jane Dunlap in 1840.

## Baptist Beginnings

The earliest Hopper ancestor we can trace with confidence is Blackgrove Hopper (1759-1831), who migrated from Fauquier County, Virginia through Greene, Tennessee, finally settling in Lancaster, Garrard County, Kentucky. Blackgrove was a Baptist minister who performed many marriages on the Kentucky frontier. His son Joseph Hopper (1782-1860), born in Fauquier County, Virginia, followed his father into the same frontier Baptist tradition.

This was the religious inheritance—Baptist preaching and frontier faith—that defined the Hopper family until 1840.

## The Presbyterian Dunlaps Enter the Story

On February 11, 1840, in Fayette County, Kentucky, Joseph Hopper married Mary Jane Dunlap. This was not simply a marriage between two individuals; it was the convergence of two very different religious heritages.

Mary Jane Dunlap (1814-1906) came from what one family historian described as "one of the oldest and most distinguished of the Scotch-Irish Presbyterian families of the South." Her father, Major William Dunlap III (1744-1816), was descended from a remarkable line of Scottish Presbyterian scholars and ministers.

The Dunlap Presbyterian lineage was deep and distinguished:

- [William Dunlop (1654-1703)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Dunlop_(principal)) was a Scottish Covenanter, Principal of the University of Glasgow, and the first Presbyterian pastor in South Carolina
- [William Dunlop Jr. (1692-1720)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Dunlop_(ecclesiastical_historian)) was a professor of church history at the University of Edinburgh and defender of the Westminster Confession of Faith
- [Alexander Dunlop (1682-1747)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Dunlop_(scholar)) taught the famed economist Adam Smith Greek at Glasgow University
- Rev. Alexander Dunlap worked as a Presbyterian minister with sympathies to the Covenanter Party

These were not casual Presbyterians. The Dunlaps represented a learned, confessional Presbyterian tradition rooted in Scottish Covenanter theology and Westminster orthodoxy.

## The Transitional Generation: George Dunlap Hopper

When Joseph and Mary Jane's son was born on October 29, 1848, in Lancaster, Kentucky, they named him George Dunlap Hopper. The choice of middle name was significant—he carried his mother's Presbyterian surname, a marker of the Dunlap heritage that would shape his religious identity.

Though the genealogical record does not explicitly state when or how George became Presbyterian, the evidence is clear: he did not follow his father's Baptist tradition. Instead, George married Katherine E. Higgins on October 7, 1875, a woman described as a "Lifelong Presbyterian." Their household was Presbyterian, and George became deeply committed to the faith.

[His obituary](/post/george-dunlap-hopper-obituary-1913/) from August 1913 records that he "had been a member of the Presbyterian Church nearly 45 years"—dating his commitment to Presbyterianism to around 1868, when he would have been about twenty years old. He served as a deacon and later as an elder in the Stanford Presbyterian Church. The obituary describes him as "a great church worker and a regular attendant at the services as long as his health would permit."

George Dunlap Hopper was the hinge generation. Born to a Baptist father and a Presbyterian mother, raised in a Kentucky where both traditions competed for souls, he chose his mother's faith.

## A Multi-Generational Presbyterian Legacy

George and Katherine's children all became Presbyterian:

- Rev. William Higgins Hopper served as pastor of the Presbyterian church in Burnside, Kentucky
- Professor Walter Owsley Hopper became superintendent of the High School at Mt. Sterling
- Margaret Higgins Hopper taught at Stanford High School
- George Dunlap Hopper Jr. graduated with honors from Central University (a Presbyterian institution)
- Rev. Joseph Hopper (1892-1971) became one of the most influential figures in the family's history

Joseph Hopper, George's youngest son, was ordained as a Presbyterian minister and served as a missionary to Korea for 34 years (1920-1954). He was an elder in the Stanford Presbyterian Church before departing for the mission field. His brother Joseph Barron Hopper also became a Presbyterian minister and missionary to Korea.

The pattern continued into subsequent generations. [Joseph's children](/post/hopper-antecedents/)—including my grandfather Joe B. Hopper—were all raised Presbyterian. The Hopper family remained committed to Presbyterian churches, Presbyterian missions, and Presbyterian theology throughout the 20th century.

## The Dunlap Difference

What explains this dramatic religious shift? Why did George Dunlap Hopper and all his descendants choose Presbyterianism over their father's Baptist heritage?

The most compelling explanation lies in the influence of Mary Jane Dunlap and the distinguished Presbyterian tradition she represented. The Dunlaps were not frontier Baptists trying to establish a foothold in the wilderness—they were educated, culturally established Scotch-Irish Presbyterians with roots in Glasgow University and the Westminster Confession. Major William Dunlap III had been a prominent figure in Lexington, Kentucky, serving as farmer, butcher, and even mayor.

When Joseph Hopper married Mary Jane Dunlap, he married into a family with social standing, educational attainment, and a confessional Presbyterian identity that stretched back to the Scottish Reformation. For their children, particularly George Dunlap Hopper, the choice between frontier Baptist revivalism and established Presbyterian orthodoxy may not have been difficult.

Mary Jane lived until 1906, long enough to see her son George firmly established as a Presbyterian elder and to see her grandchildren growing up in the Presbyterian church. She witnessed the fruit of the religious tradition she brought into the Hopper family.

## Conclusion

The Hopper family's Presbyterian identity—which produced multiple ministers, missionaries, and theological educators across four generations—can be traced directly to Mary Jane Dunlap. Through her marriage to Joseph Hopper in 1840, she brought the Dunlap family's distinguished Scotch-Irish Presbyterian heritage into a family of frontier Baptist preachers.

Her son George Dunlap Hopper became the first Presbyterian in the Hopper line, and every subsequent generation followed. The [Dunlap Presbyterian legacy](/post/dunlap-family/), rooted in Scottish Covenanter theology and Westminster orthodoxy, became the Hopper legacy as well.

When frontier Baptist simplicity met learned Presbyterian confessionalism in a farmhouse in Garrard County, Kentucky, Presbyterianism won—not through force or argument, but through the quiet influence of a woman whose family had been defending the Reformed faith since the days of the Westminster Assembly.
