## Hopper.

Mr. George D. Hopper, one of the most prominent and popular citizens of Lincoln county, is dead. He was in his sixty-fifth year, had been a member of the Presbyterian church for forty-five years, and had all these years lived a consistent Christian. He was a member of the Masonic fraternity. That veteran minister and much beloved citizen, Rev. Joseph H. Hopper, of Perryville, is a surviving brother, a widow and the following children are also left to mourn the loss of a loving husband and devoted father: Rev. W. H. Hopper, pastor of the Presbyterian church at Burnside; Prof. W. O. Hopper, Superintendent of the High School at Mt. Sterling; Miss Margaret Hopper; Mr. George D. Hopper, who graduated with the honors of his class from Central University last June, and Mr. Joseph H. Hopper, a leading student of C. U. Dr. P. L. Bruce conducted the funeral services at the late residence Tuesday afternoon, the Masons concluding the services at the grave in Buffalo Cemetery, in the presence of one of the largest crowds that ever gathered there on a like occasion.
