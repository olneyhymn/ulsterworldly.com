The most recent issue of the [OPC magazine New Horizons](https://opc.org/nh.html?issue_id=276) features an article by historian and OPC ruling elder D.G. Hart entitled [Machen's Magazines](https://opc.org/nh.html?article_id=1009). 

Harts starts, "To claim that the Orthodox Presbyterian Church would not exist if not for a magazine is a bit of a stretch but has enough proximity to historical circumstances to be plausible." He goes on to discuss _The Presbyterian_, _Christianity Today_, _The Presbyterian_, and _New Horizons_, each of which were used to inform "ordinary readers about the details and significance of the church struggle."
