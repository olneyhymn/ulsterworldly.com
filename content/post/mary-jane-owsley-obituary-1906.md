## OWSLEY

After gradually sinking for several months from the weakness incident to extreme age, Mrs. Mary Jane Owsley breathed her last about 12 o'clock Sunday night. Mrs. Owsley, who was a Miss Dunlap, was born in Fayette county 92 years ago and when quite young united in marriage with Joseph Hopper and to them were born two children, Mrs. Mattie Withers and Mr. George D. Hopper, both of this place. Mr. Hopper died many years since and Mrs. Owsley some years later became the wife of Jonathan Owsley, who also preceded her to the grave. At the age of 22 the deceased joined the Presbyterian church and throughout her long and useful life remained a devout member. Mrs. Owsley spent her early life in Fayette and Garrard counties, but for nearly 40 years had made her home with her son in this county, at whose home she died. After short services by Rev. Gilbert Glass at 10:30 this morning the remains will be removed from her late home and consigned to the tomb in Buffalo cemetery. A life that was long and useful, filled with christian virtues and worthy of emulation has come to a perfect close. Let not her devoted ones weep, for the reward of those who lived in God's grace is rich and everlasting - and truly this is hers.
