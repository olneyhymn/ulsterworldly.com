My church just replaced our copies of the _Book of Psalms for Singing_ with the new [_Trinity Psalter Hymnal_](https://www.wtsbooks.com/trinity-psalter-hymnal-great-commission-publications-gcp-tph1010) published by the OPC and URCNA. I was asked to present an introduction to this new song book in our Sunday school class.
