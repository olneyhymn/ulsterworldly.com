_The follow obituary was printed in the The [Rock Hill, SC] Record on June 24, 1909. Archibald Alexander Barron was the father of my great grandmother Annis Barron Hopper._

Rock Hill has suffered another sad bereavement in the death of a splendid citizen, Mr. A. A. [Archibald Alexander] Barron, who passed away at 12:15 Wednesday morning, at his home in [Oakland Avenue](https://goo.gl/maps/y26intYXWR42), after an illness of about two weeks. The immediate cause of death was an affection of the heart. He had been known to be critically ill several days prior to his death.

Modest and unassuming in manner, Mr. Barron was nevertheless noted for his faithfulness to whatever trust was imposed in him. He will be sorely missed, not only by his devoted family, but by all who called him friend.

The sympathy of the entire community goes out to the sorrowing ones in their affliction.

Alexander A. Barron was born in the Clay Hill section of York county, May 26, 1851, and was at the time of his death about 58 years old. He was the son of James Leroy Barron and Amanda (Barnett) Barron, and, until his removal to Ebenezer, lived all his life in his native section - Clay Hill. Mr. Barron has for years been one of the most successful planters in his vicinity and until two years ago, was actively engaged in operating his large farm at Ebenezer.

Several years ago he and two of his sons, Messrs. R. E. and W. L. Barron, organized the Rock HIll Hardware Company, of this city, of which he was president at the time of his death.

About thirty years ago, he was happily married to Miss Mary Robert Partlow, of Wright's Ferry. To them were born eight children, all of whom are living, as follows: W. L., R. E., Dr. Archibald, John and Earl, Mrs. E. B. Hunter, of Arkansas, Misses Lottie and Anice [Annis].  These, with a loving wife are left to mourn his loss.

Besides his immediate family, Mr. Barron leaves the following: His brothers; William Barron, of Belmont, J. B. Barron, of Tirzah, John R. Barron, of Rock Hill, Walter Barron, of Shelby, N.C., Paul Barron, of St. Matthews, and Mrs. T. N. Nichols, of Ebenezer. He was a nephew of Mrs. M. J. Simril, of this city.

Funeral services over the remains were held Wednesday afternoon at 5 o'clock at the [Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church](http://www.firstarp.org/), of which he had been an elder for quite a number of years. The services were conducted by Rev. A. S. Rogers, the pastor, assisted by Revs. Alexander Martin, of the [First Presbyterian Church](http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/york/S10817746028/index.htm), and J. T. Dendy, of [Ebenezer Presbyterian Church](http://ebenezerarp.org/), after which the remains were laid to rest in [Laurelwood Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurelwood_Cemetery). The following were the pallbearers:

Active—T. L. Johnston, John A. Black, R. T. Fewell, Alex. B. Fewell, J. H. Miller, Dr. J. A. Stokes, John A. Shurley, W. W. Miller.

Honorary—W. H. Mitchell, John White, Dr. J. R. Miller, R. T. Wright, J. H. B. Jenkins.

In the death of Mr. Barron Rock Hill and this community has lost one of its best citizens, the Associate Reformed Church a most loyal member and officer, and The Record one of its staunchest friends.
