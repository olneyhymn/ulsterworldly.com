My edited and newly typeset version of John G. Lorimer's work [The
Deaconship](https://amzn.to/2U84I1F) is now available in paperback on Amazon.
Lorimer was a Church of Scotland minister who joined the Free Church of Scotland
when it formed in 1843.

The book includes a forward from Dr. C. Nick Willborn of Covenant PCA in Oak
Ridge, TN:

> ​This little book also sets forth practical good the office can accomplish
> when rightly distinguished from the office of elder and fully honored through
> the recognition of and ordination of biblically qualified men. In this area,
> his work is reminiscent of Samuel Miller’s work on the eldership, especially
> in his chapter on the distinction between elders and deacons. Although the
> historical contexts in which Miller and Lorimer wrote are somewhat different,
> the astute reader will soon realize the abiding benefit this little book can
> be for the church today due to its historical and biblical faithfulness. With
> all this in mind, it is a worthy study for students, elders and deacons who
> love the church as Christ’s beloved bride and wish to serve her faithfully.
