My great-grandfather Hopper, writing about his mother's reaction to his only sister's decision to join him as a Presbyterian missionary in Korea in 1922.

> That mother through the years had endured and won in the Christian race, who had a supreme desire and joy in having her children to bear the message glorious, wrote me these words about her daughter's decision: 'It is great to have another one of my dear ones called into the Master's service.'

> Mothers with a triumphant faith like this are constantly needed that Christian witnessing may be continued 'both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.'

Margaret Hopper served in Mokpo, Korea from 1922-1940 and 1948-57.
