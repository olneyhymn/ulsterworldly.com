_When my grandparents retired as Presbyterian missionaries to Korea in 1986, their fellow missionaries in Chonju, Korea threw a "Hopper Celebration" at the Christian Medical Research Center. Merrill Grubbs and Marylyn Decamp sang this "Ditty to Dot" while Alma Grubbs played the organ._

### DITTY TO DOT
​
We sing of our neighbor, co-worker and friend,<br />
Whose work for her Master has known no end.<br />
Orphans, and mish kids, and prisoners grim<br />
Give thanks for this friend who cares so for them.<br />
Dor-o-thy...Dor-o-thy...​<br />

Tho' memories of Congo, her home, beckoned warm,<br />
A mish-kid type preacher with persuasive charm <br />
At the last minute took matters in hand,<br />
And they sailed together to Morning Calm Land.<br />
Dor-o-thy...Dor-o-thy...<br />
And they sailed together to Morning Calm Land.<br />

First to their children, Alice and Barron<br />
And later to Margaret and David, their son, <br />
She taught the three-R's and Bible too,<br />
Whilst serving up tea as all moksa's[^moska] wives do.<br />
Dor-o-thy...Dor-o-thy...<br />
Whilst serving up tea as all moksa's wives do.<br />

Now scattered around in this old world today<br />
Are dozens of women and men who would say<br />
The Child's Catechism they learned from Aunt Dot,<br />
Her legacy to them, tho' much else they forgot.<br />
Dor-o-thy...Dor-o-thy...<br />
Her legacy to them, tho' much else they forgot.<br />

Oh, many's the floor upon which she has sot,<br />
In churches, and manses, some cold and some hot.<br />
She's counseled young wives, and taught their young,<br />
And told countless ajumas[^ajumas] of Jesus, God's Son.<br />
Dor-o-thy...Dor-o-thy...<br />
And told countless ajumas of Jesus, God's Son.<br />

Since '48, Chonju's been her haunt.<br />
Joe's become "bishop", she, his confidant.<br />
Through church splits, evacuations, and sep'rations long,<br />
A model missionary - loyal and strong.<br />
Dor-o-thy...Dor-o-thy...<br />
A model missionary - loyal and strong.<br />

Her memory for sermons is phenomenal,<br />
And kept us from resorting too oft' to the barrel.<br />
Her pen produced columns for "Thought of the Times",<br />
And for special occasions wrote poems and rhymes.<br />
Dor-o-thy... Dor-o-thy...<br />
And for special occasions wrote poems and rhymes.<br />

From Dragon's Head Ridge to [Montreat]()https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreat,_North_Carolina's mountains blue<br />
Now goes our dear Dorothy and Bishop Joe, too.<br />
Tho' those of us here'll be bereft of her charms,<br />
Her gran'chillun will welcome her with wide open arms.<br />
Dor-o-thy...Dor-o-thy...<br />
Her gran'chillun will welcome her with wide open arms.<br />

[^moska]: Moska (목사) is Korean for Minister.
[^ajumas]: Married women (아줌마).
