I have served as a deacon in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC) since 2014. On the Hopper side, I'm a 5th generation Presbyterian officer. Here are my ancestors who served as officers.

## Father

My father, David Hopper, is a ruling elder in the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA). He was previously a ruling elder in the Evangelical Presbyterian Church (EPC).

## Grandfather

My grandfather [Joe Barron Hopper](https://ulsterworldly.com/people/joe-b.-hopper) (1921–1992) was ordained by the Montgomery Presbytery of the PCUS in 1945. He served as a PCUS (and later PCUSA) missionary to Korea for 38 years. 

## Great Grandfathers

[Joseph Hopper](https://ulsterworldly.com/people/joseph-hopper/) (1892–1971), father of Joe Barron, was ordained by the West Lexington Presbytery (PCUS) in 1917. He served as a missionary to Korea. 

[Hershey Longenecker](https://ulsterworldly.com/people/hershey-longenecker) (1889-1978) was ordained by the Presbytery of Transylvania (PCUS) in 1916. Hershey was a first-generation Presbyterian (coming from an anabaptist family), as was his wife (coming from a Methodist family). He served as a missionary in the Congo.

## Great Great Grandfathers

[George Dunlap Hopper](https://ulsterworldly.com/people/george-dunlap-hopper) (1848–1913), a farmer and businessman, served as a deacon for 11 years and then a ruling elder at [Stanford Presbyterian (PCUS)](https://www.stanfordpresbyterian.org) in Kentucky, where he was a member for 45 years. 
George may have been the first Presbyterian Hopper; his grandfather, Blackgrove Hopper (1759–1831), was a Baptist minister. 

[Archibald Alexander Barron](https://ulsterworldly.com/people/archibald-alexander-barron) (1851–1909) was the father of Annis Barron Hopper, wife of Joseph Hopper. He served as an elder at [Tirzah](https://ulsterworldly.com/churches/tirzah-arp/) and [First Associate Reformed Presbyterian](https://ulsterworldly.com/churches/first-arp-rock-hill/) in Rock Hill, SC. He was a farmer and owner of Rock Hill Hardware.

The Barron line almost certainly includes more elders and deacons, though I do not have records.
