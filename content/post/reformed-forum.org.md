I discovered the Reformed Forum's flagship podcast _Christ the Center_ during Thanksgiving Break of 2008 from Reformation21's mention of Carl Trueman's interview on [_A Brief History of Trinitarian Thought_](https://reformedforum.org/ctc42/). I enjoyed listening to the interview on my iPod while raking my parents' leaves. I enjoyed and benefited from the episode and immediately went back to my computer to subscribe.

Earlier that year, I'd graduated from college and moved away from the [church](http://www.hillcrestpresbyterian.org) where I'd been introduced to confessional presbyterianism; I had joined another PCA congregation but was still working out where my theological commitments lay. Ten years later, I have listened to nearly every Christ the Center episode produced. From it, I have learned more about Scripture, God, theology, church history, and more; it has helped shape me as a person, Christian, church member, deacon, husband, and father. 

Many of my favorite episodes have been historical: 

* [Presbyterian and Reformed Family Trees](https://reformedforum.org/ctc130/) with Darryl Hart
* [The Life and Thought of Herman Bavinck](https://reformedforum.org/ctc158/) with Ron Gleason    
* [The Synod of Dorr's Deliverance on the Sabbath](https://reformedforum.org/ctc450/) with Danny Hyde
* [Johannes Oecolampadius](https://reformedforum.org/ctc269/) with Dianne Poythress
* [Geerhardus Vos](https://reformedforum.org/ctc63/)
* [Episodes on The Westminster Assembly](https://reformedforum.org/people/chad-van-dixhoorn/) with Chad Van Dixhoorn
* [J. Gresham Machen](https://ulsterworldly.com/post/hart-on-machen/) with Darryl Hart
* [Luther and Media](https://reformedforum.org/ctc94/) with Carl Trueman
* [The Life and Ministry of Rev. John P. Galbraith](https://reformedforum.org/ctc441/) with John Galbraith and Danny Olinger 

The list of historical episodes could go on and one. Moverover, _Christ the Center_ has helped me understand apologetics, union with Christ, Vos's _Biblical Theology_, ecclesiology, and more. 

I look forward to the next ten years of growth through the resources provided by the _Reformed Forum_. Thank you to Camden Bucky, Jeff Waddington, Jim Cassidy, Glen Clary, Darryl Hart, Lane Tipton, and the many guests who have played an important role in my life from afar; I'm grateful for your selfless service to Christ's church. I pray the Lord continues to bless your efforts.
