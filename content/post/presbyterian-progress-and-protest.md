Dr. Chad Van Dixhoorn has [recently been appointed](https://faculty.wts.edu/posts/van-dixhoorn/) _Professor of Church History and Director of the Craig Center for the Study of the Westminster Standards_ at Westminster Theological Seminary. Dr. Van Dixhoorn is an OPC minister and a leading expert on the Westminster Assembly.

He spoke at a WTS chapel last fall on "Presbyterian Progress & Protest in the Late 19th and Early 20th Centuries". In the talk, he outlines the rise of liberalism and unbelief in the PCUSA that lead to the formation of the OPC and Westminster Theological Seminary.

The talk is worth your time.
