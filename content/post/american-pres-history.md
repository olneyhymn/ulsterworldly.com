My friend Matthew Ezzell and I taught a Sunday school class on American Presbyterian History at [Shiloh Presbyterian Church](https://shilohopc.org). 

Here was the overview we wrote for the course: 

> This class provides an understanding of the historical foundations of modern presbyterianism in America. We cover the breadth of the streams contributing to the presbyterian churches and denominations of our country. In the course, we learn about the controversies and conflicts and also spread of the gospel and the propagation churches throughout the United States. We specially emphasize the origin and development of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and the establishment of presbyterianism in central North Carolina.
