On June 11, the [Orthodox Presbyterian Church](http://www.opc.org) turned 82. On that day, the [Presbyterian Constitutional Covenant Union](http://www.thisday.pcahistory.org/2013/06/june-27-the-presbyterian-constitutional-covenant-union/), which had been formed the year before by a small group of PCUSA members who desired a biblically reformed church, met for the last time.[^pccu]

You can learn more about the foundtion of the OPC in Darryl Hart and John Muether's [Fighting the Good Fight: A Brief History of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church](https://store.opc.org/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=H%2DFighting%2Dthe%2Dgood%2Dfight), Edwin Rian's [The Presbyterian Conflict](https://store.opc.org/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=H%2Dpresb%2Dconflict), and Robert Churchill's [Lest We Forget: A Personal Reflection on the Formation of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church](https://store.opc.org/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=H%2DLest%2Dwe%2Dforget), all published by the OPC Committee on the Historian.[^ebooks]

A few years ago, Dr. Hart, who did doctoral studies on Machen, [taught a Sunday school class](https://ulsterworldly.com/post/hart-on-machen/) on Machen's role in these events. [His book on Machen](https://amzn.to/2IcRiZh) is also in invaluable resource.

Last year, I prepared an [interactive timeline of the events of the Presbyterian Conflict](https://ulsterworldly.com/presbyterian-conflict/) leading to the formation of the OPC. The story is also outline by someone outside the OPC in Bradley Longfield's [The Presbyterian Controversy: Fundamentalists, Modernists, and Moderates](https://amzn.to/2yvGxSx).

The OPC digitized issues of the [Presbyterian Guardian](https://www.opc.org/guardian.html), an independent magazine published by conservative presbyterians from 1935-1979; the issue [just after the formation of the OPC](https://www.opc.org/cfh/guardian/Volume_2/1936-06-22.pdf) is an enlighting original source on the events. The OPC has recently published [old minutes of its General Assemblies online](https://opcgaminutes.org); the minutes from the first are [here](https://opcgaminutes.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1936-GA-1.pdf).

[^pccu]: Edwin Rian wrote an article entitled "Why the Constitutional Covenant Union" in the [first edition of the Presbyterian Guardian](http://www.opc.org/cfh/guardian/Volume_1/1935-10-07.pdf).
[^ebooks]: You can access Rian's book as an [ebook](https://store.opc.org/SearchResults.asp?Cat=1823) and read "Fighting the Good Fight" at [OPC.org](http://www.opc.org/books/fighting/pt1.html).
