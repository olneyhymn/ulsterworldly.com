From Sean Lucas's [For a Continuing Church: The Roots of the Presbyterian Church in America](https://www.amazon.com/Continuing-Church-Roots-Presbyterian-America/dp/1629951064):

> The only response that the PCUS leadership could offer was “experimental” worship as a way of connecting with young people. One such 1968 service offered at Montreat received a full review in the pages of Presbyterian Journal: electric guitars and folk music, especially Bob Dylan’s anthem “Blowin’ in the Wind,” a dialogue in place of the sermon that focused on social-gospel causes with no Bible references at all, and a lack of traditional liturgical structures. 

> The evening service was more of the same: a jazz trio, a movie that focused on race  and poverty, a message that called for economic and political justice, a litany that focused on social sins, the Lord’s Supper accompanied by “We Shall Overcome,” and the service’s ending with “sacramental applause.”
