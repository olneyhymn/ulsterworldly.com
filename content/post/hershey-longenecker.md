J. Hershey Longenecker, born May 23, 1889, was a Southern Presbyterian missionary in the town of Luebo in what is now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1917 to 1950. Sometime after his retirement, he was interviewed about his time in Africa. In the interview, he discusses a whole variety of matters, including Witch Doctors, Crocodiles, Hippopotamuses, Cannibals, Missionary Life, Handwriting, and Albert Schweitzer.
