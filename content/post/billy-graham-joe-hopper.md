At the funeral of my grandfather Joe B. Hopper—retired PCUS missionary of Korea—the minister read the following remarks from Billy and Ruth Graham. Joe and Ruth knew each other as teenagers in Korea, and they later lived on the same street in Montreat, North Carolina.

Ruth and I wish to take this means of publicly extending our heartfelt love and deepest sympathy to Dot and to each member of Joe's family.  

He was a godly and effective missionary of Jesus Christ. We believe that he is now with his Lord Jesus in heaven. And while we shall miss him, we rejoice in the victory Christ has gained for him.  

When we first began to explore the amazing possibility of going into North Korea with the Christian message, we turned to Joe for advice. He gave us much wise and invaluable counsel in making this mission possible. The council he gave us was followed by his earnest prayers and his joyful enthusiasm, right up to the last moments of his life.  

We believe the words of Jesus, “Well done, good and faithful servant; enter into the joy of the Lord.” And we believe these words are truly appropriate for Joe at this hour. 

We continue to pray for his remarkable missionary family. And the continued expansion of their Christian heritage and ministry. 

Devotedly,  

Love in Christ,  

Billy and Ruth Graham 

April 29, 1992
