My Hopper great grandparents became missionaries in Korea in 1920. Joseph Hopper's first sermon preached in Korea was to a congregation of 250 in a leper colony:

> As the service began, a strange and wonderful feeling came over me. I had never seen that many people at a preparatory communion service beforeâ€”and they were Korean lepers! What an inspiration to hear them sing.

> 'O, for a thousand tongues to sing,
> My great Redeemer's praise,
> The glories of my Lord and King,
> The triumphs of his grace.'

> The words were foreign to me, but not the tune, nor the spirit in which they sang it.

My grandfather, Joe B. Hopper, became a missionary to Korea in 1948. He wrote:

> Some of the happiest experiences have been in churches where all the members have leprosy... More than once I have served communion to men like this where the bread had to be placed in palm of his hand because he had no fingers with which to pick it up, and where the cup had to be held to his lips for the same reason!

> Doesn't this illustrate what our Saviour has done for a dreadfully sick world, doomed to die, separated by the disease of sin from the presence of the Heavenly father?

> I once heard of one of these people at the Wilson Leprosy Colony who publicly thanked God for giving him this dread disease because otherwise he might never have been cared for in a mission hospital and heard of the saving power of Jesus Christ.
