In April 1972, my dad, a senior at King College, spent a weekend in Montreat, North Carolina. After worshipping at Montreat Presbyterian, Mrs. Ruth Bell Graham--who was a member at MPC--invited dad to Billy and Ruth's house on Mississippi Road for lunch. In a letter to his parents (who were serving as missionaries in Korea), dad recounts watching the [Apollo 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_16) launch with the Graham's after lunch:


> "Mrs Graham invited (my 2 friends) and me up for lunch. It was the first time I had been up (to the Graham house), and it was quite interesting. Dr. Graham was there and we watched the [[Apollo 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_16)] space shot go off during lunch. 
> 
> He said that NBC has asked him to narrate the shot with [John Chancellor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chancellor) but he had turned them down. It was very interesting talking to him. He really does know the Bible inside out. I got away a little later than planned....
