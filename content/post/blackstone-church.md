My grandmother Dorothy “Dot” Longenecker Hopper was born March 26, 1920 in the Belgian Congo to PCUS missionaries Jay Hershey and Minnie Hauhart Longenecker.

She earned her B.A. in English at Queens College and received her Master’s in Christian Education at the Presbyterian School for Christian Education in Richmond (formerly The Assembly’s Training School) with a thesis entitled "The Advantages and Disadvantages of the Second Generation Foreign Missionaries of the Presbyterian Church U.S."

After graduation in 1943, she moved to Blackstone, Virginia (40 miles southwest of Richmond) to serve as Director of Christian Education at Blackstone Presbyterian Church, pastored by Rev. Thomas Fry. While church could not afford to pay her a salary, she was paid by the PCUS Defense Counsel due to its proximity to [Fort Pickett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Pickett)

In 1941 she was eagerly awaiting the arrival of her parents when a cablegram brought word that they could not come due to submarine activity in the Caribbean and of course, the only transportation available was by ship which meant waiting for 2 ½ more years to see them. This was a big blow to her. Dot had planned to live at Mission Court with them, but Dr. and Mrs. Henry Mack on the A.T.S. faculty invited her to live in their Home. Upon graduation she went to Blackstone, Virginia, to work with the Reverend Thomas and Louise Fry. She was paid by the Defense Council to work with serviceman and their families seeking to bring them nearer to Christ and within the Christian fellowship of the Blackstone Church.
