My great grandfather Hershey Longenecker and his wife Minnie served as Southern Presbyterian missionaries to the Belgian Congo from 1917 to 1951. In retirement, he wrote a memoir of his life and ministry entitled [Memories of Congo](https://congo.ulsterworldly.com/). Some time ago, my dad's cousin digitized the book, and he gave me permission to host it at [congo.ulsterworldly.com](https://congo.ulsterworldly.com).

Update (Feburary 21, 2024): [Memories of Congo is now available as a Kindle ebook](https://amzn.to/48mFBvb).
