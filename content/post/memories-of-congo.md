My great grandfather Hershey Longenecker and his wife Minnie served as Southern Presbyterian missionaries to the Belgian Congo from 1917 to 1951. In retirement, he wrote a memoir of his life and ministry entitled [Memories of Congo](https://congo.ulsterworldly.com/). Some time ago, my dad's cousin digitized the book, and he gave me permission to host it at [https://congo.ulsterworldly.com](congo.ulsterworldly.com).
