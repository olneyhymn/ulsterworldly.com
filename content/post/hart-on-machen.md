**Update**: In September 2022, the Reformed Forum released [an updated course on Machen taught by Dr. Hart](https://reformedforum.org/courses/machen-and-the-presbyterian-controversy/).

In 2010, Dr. Darryl Hart (OPC assistant historian and Machen scholar) taught a Sunday school series at Glenside Presbyterian Church on J. Gresham Machen about J. Gresham Machen and the founding of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. Camden Bucey of the [Reformed Forum](http://reformedforum.org) kindly recorded the whole series for posterity.[^recordquality]

Here are the lectures:

1.  [J. Gresham Machen: Fighter of the Good Fight](http://reformedforum.org/podcasts/he004/)
2.  [What Prepared Machen to Fight?](http://reformedforum.org/podcasts/he5/)
3.  [Machen and the Crisis of Western Civilization](http://reformedforum.org/podcasts/he6/)
4.  [Ecumenism and Intolerance](http://reformedforum.org/podcasts/he7/)
5.  [Liberalism, the Different Religion](http://reformedforum.org/podcasts/he8/)
6.  [The Fight Against False Optimism](http://reformedforum.org/podcasts/he9/)
7.  [The Fight Against Tyranny](http://reformedforum.org/podcasts/he10/)
8.  [The Fight Against Liberalism: Foreign Missions](http://reformedforum.org/podcasts/he12/)
9.  [The Fight Against Sentimentality](http://reformedforum.org/podcasts/he13/)
10.  [The Basis on Which Machen Fought: The Bible](http://reformedforum.org/podcasts/he14/)
11. [Assessing Machen](https://reformedforum.org/podcasts/he15/)

Hart's book on Machen, [Defending the Faith: J. Gresham Machen and the Crisis of Conservative Protestantism in Modern America](http://amzn.to/2wih1Lj), is similarly excellent.


[^recordquality]: The quality of the recording on the first couple of lectures is poor, but the improve over time.
