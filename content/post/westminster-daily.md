<p>To encourage Christians to read the Westminster Standards, Dr. Joey Pipa Jr. has prepared <a href="/westminster-daily/reading-plan">a calendar of readings</a> from these three documents. By following his calendar, you will read through the Standards every year. With this site, you can find the daily readings at <a href="http://www.reformedconfessions.com/westminster-daily">reformedconfessions.com/westminster-daily</a>, on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/westminsterdaily/">Facebook</a>, on <a href="https://twitter.com/refconfessions">Twitter</a>, and in your <a href="https://feed.press/e/mailverify?feed_id=westminster-daily">email</a>.</p>
