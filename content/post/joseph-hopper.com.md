My great-grandfather Joseph Hopper and my grandfather Joseph Barron Hopper were both Southern Presbyterian pastors and missionaries to Korea. Both men left behind a number writings of various kinds. I have started to upload scans of these writings (mostly written on a typewriter) to [Joseph-Hopper.com](http://joseph-hopper.com). I hope to add more to this as time permits.
