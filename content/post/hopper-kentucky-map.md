This interactive map shows Kentucky locations significant to the Hopper family's Presbyterian heritage, including churches where they worshiped and served, educational institutions where they studied and taught, burial sites, residences, and locations of evangelistic ministry.

The Hopper family's roots in [Kentucky Presbyterianism](/post/kentucky-presbyterianism/) run deep, spanning multiple generations from the early 1800s through the mid-1900s. Their story connects to major institutions and movements in Southern Presbyterian history, including Centre College, Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the mountain mission work of [Edward O. Guerrant's Soul Winners Society](/post/kentucky-presbyterianism/).
