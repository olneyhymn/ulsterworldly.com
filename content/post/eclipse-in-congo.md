The recent solar eclipse reminded my dad that his grandfather had seen the [1919 eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_May_29,_1919) in Congo. My great grandfather recounts the story in [his memoir](http://www.jesuscares4.us/memories/ch2.htm):

> One day in mid-afternoon I was teaching a Bible class in the grass-roofed chapel. The roof was rather low at the edges, so most of our light was reflected from the ground. It grew darker and darker, until we could not see to read. I told the students we had better get home before the storm broke. We stepped outside, but to our great surprise there was no storm. But it continued to grow darker and darker. There was a total eclipse of the sun.

> Mr. Stilz got a photograph showing a perfect corona. Some days later I started on my homeward journey, but I was to go out of my way to visit Bibanga station. I arrived there in four or five days. A few days out from [Lusambo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusambo) a village chief asked me in all seriousness whether it was true, as he had heard, that a white man reached up his hand, and covered the sun.
