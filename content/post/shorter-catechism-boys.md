In 1910, B.B. Warfield wrote, [^warfield_catechism]

> It is worth while to be a Shorter Catechism boy. They grow to be men. And better than that, they are exceedingly apt to grow to be men of God. So apt, that we cannot afford to have them miss the chance of it. ‘Train up a child in the way he should go, and even when he is old he will not depart from it.’

Warfield knew that learning the Shorter Catechism wasn't easy. "The Shorter Catechism is, perhaps, not very easy to learn. And very certainly it will not
teach itself. Its framers were less careful to make it easy than to make it good." He goes on:

> We think, nevertheless, that the acquisition of arithmetic, grammar and reading is worth the pains its costs the teacher to teach, and the pain it
costs the learner to learn them. Do we not think the acquisition of the grounds of religion worth some effort, and even, if need be, some tears?

Tim Challies recently echoed Warfield's sentiment on Twitter:

Since I read Tim's tweet, I have been trying to compile a list of examples.

## J. Gresham Machen (1881-1937)

In the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversies of the early 20th century, Machen was a stalwart defender of the truth. Late in his life, Machen said that from his parents he "learned what Christianity is and how
it differs from certain modern substitutes."[^christianity_in_conflict]

Of his education he wrote:

> In Baltimore I attended a good private school. It was purely secular; and in it I learned nothing about the Bible or the great things of our Christian faith. But I did not need to learn about those things in any school; for **I learned them from my mother at home. That was the best school of all; and in it, without any merit of my own, I will venture to say that I had acquired a better knowledge of the contents of the Bible at twelve years of age than is possessed by many theological students of the present day. The Shorter Catechism was not omitted.** I repeated it perfectly, questions and answers, at a very tender age; and the divine revelation of which it is so glorious a summary was stored up in my mind and heart.[^christianity_in_conflict]

In his memoir of Machen, Ned Stonehouse quotes from a letter young Machen wrote to his mother while she was away[^stonehouse]:

> Arly [brother Arthur] desected a beetle, and let me see him do it, and I like it verry much. I have finished Mathu, and nearly finished Mark, and then I am going to begin at the very beginning of the whole bible. Any said over his cattercisum, and made only one mistake. *It seems to me that on sunday I can never get a nuf off my cattercisum.* I like it so much and Poply always heres me on sunday, and some tims in the week.

> You know that little book I told you about in my other letter, and read sum in efry morning, and I learn one of the little verses by hart, and then I find out where they are in the bible, and Carry looks them out in the revised vershun and I like it verry much and do it very often. *It seems to me that sundays get nicer and nicer becous Poply reads me in pilgrime progres and hears me my cattercisum, and I like it very much.* I like to play hook and lader verry much and bild up houses and play that they gech on fire and I like it verry much and do it verry much. I read in that little book so much that I forget to tar of my calnder I like it so much.

Stonehouse concludes[^stonehouse]:

> *In mature life Machen often paid tribute to the instruction in the Bible that he received at his mother’s knee.* At twelve years of age his knowledge of its contents, including the names and character of all the kings of Israel and Judah, he later observed, surpassed that of the average theological student of his day. *There was, moreover, careful instruction in the Westminster Shorter Catechism and a commitment to memory of questions and answers. To this he later attributed, to a significant degree, his love of the noble tradition of the Reformed Faith as expressed in its classic symbols as over against the meager skeletal creeds of a mere “Fundamentalism.”*


## John Newton

John Newton, the author of Amazing Grace and "perhaps the greatest pastoral letter-writer of all time" (J.I. Packer), [wrote of his upbringing](https://books.google.com/books?id=vI9TAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA7&ots=3smo1UrdLm&dq=%22My%20mother%20was%20a%20Dissenter%2C%20a%20pious%20woman%2C%20and%20a%20member%20of%20the%20late%22&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false):

> My mother was a Dissenter, a pious woman, and a member of the late Dr. Jenning’s church. She was of a weak, consumptive habit, and loved retirement; and as I was her only child, she made it the chief business and pleasure of her life to instruct me, and bring me up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Have been told that from my birth she had, in her mind, devoted me to the ministry; and that, had she lived till I was of a proper age, I was to have been sent to St. Andrews, in Scotland, to be educated. But the Lord had appointed otherwise.

> I was rather of a sedentary turn, not active and playful, as boys commonly are, but seemed as willing to learn as my mother was to teach me. I had some capacity, and a retentive memory. **When I was 4 years old, I could read (hard names excepted) as well as I can now; and could likewise repeat the answers to the questions in the Assembly’s Shorter Catechism, with the proofs, and all Dr. Watt’s smaller Catechisms, and his Children’s Hymns.**

## Joseph Hopper

> We always had daily prayers in our home. They were usually held at the breakfast table with read of a chapter of Hubert’s _Bible Story Book_ and prayer. If Father was home, he was the leader, but when he was away, Mother took his place. *When morning school work began, we were required to memorized some verses of Scripture and the answers in the _Westminster Shorter Catechism_. I still have the diploma given by the _Christian Observer_ for reciting the _Shorter Catechism in April 1932 when I was less than eleven years old.* As was the custom, I wrote a letter to the editor which was printed, as follows:

> Dear Mr. Converse:

> I am a boy of eleven years old. I have recited the _Shorter Catechism_ to my mother. Please put my name on the Roll of Honor and send me a diploma. Father is a missionary in Korea. ...

> Your little friend, Joseph Barron Hopper

## Charles Hodge

Paul C. Gutjahr [Charles Hodge: Guardian of American Orthodoxy](http://amzn.to/2fBE93y)

> Reading, writing, and arithmetic were not the only subjects Hodge studied in his formative Philadelphia years. His mother emphasized religious training as well. She regularly brought Hodge and his older brother to be drilled in the memorization and recitation of the Westminster Shorter Catechism. Such recitations were a common tradition among Scottish Presbyterians. On a regular basis, Hodge presented himself ramrod straight before Ashbel Green and answered his pastor's queries from the Catechism.

> ...

> Learning and reciting the catechism was an intensely religious ordeal, but those who had mastered it in their youth often proudly recited its contents well into old age. It was a highly formalized and structured way of teaching that Presbyterians made great use of throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Hodge learned his lessons well, and the doctrines he memorized as a boy provided the foundation for the theological views he held his entire life.

## B.B. Warfield

Fred Zaspel http://amzn.to/2fC7avZ cites B.B. Warfield’s brother Ethelbert:

> youthful objects had little effect in a household where the shorter catechism was ordinarily completed in the sixth year, followed at once by the proofs from the Scriptures, and then by the larger catechism, with an appropriate amount of Scripture memorized in regular course each Sabbath afternoon.

[^warfield_catechism]: I commend Warfield's [Is the Shorter Catechism Worthwhile?](http://www.newhopefairfax.org/files/21.%20SC%20worth%20while.pdf) wholeheartedly.
