# The Works of Joseph Hopper and Joe B. Hopper


<span class="lead">Joseph Hopper (1892-1971) served as a PCUS missionary in Korea from 1919 to 1956</span>. He was raised in Kentucky and attended Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary and Union Presbyterian Seminary (VA).

<span class="lead">His son, Joseph (Joe) Barron Hopper (1921-1992) served as a PSUS and PCUSA missionary to Korea for 38 years</span>. Having grown up in Korea, he returned to the USA to attend Davidson College and Union Presbyterian Seminary (VA). After several years in the pastorate, he and his wife Dorothy moved to Korea to join the mission.

Both men left behind a number of writings from sermon notes to seminary papers to books. Some of those works are provided here in scanned form. For more information, contact <a href="mailto:mail@joseph-hopper.com">mail@joseph-hopper.com</a>.
