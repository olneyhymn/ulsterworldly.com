quote = """ I am very much opposed to drinking wine. There are many reasons for not drinking, but isn't this the most important: Suppose I drink a lot and lose my senses. While in this state, if the Lord should return, how could I meet Him with joy? There are  many other reasons against drinking, but to me this is the most important. The same thing is true of all other sins. How ashamed would we be if He should come and find us in sin! I hope that when He comes I will be busy preaching in some church or about some other work of the Lord. The best way to prepare for His coming is to be busy doing His work."""
