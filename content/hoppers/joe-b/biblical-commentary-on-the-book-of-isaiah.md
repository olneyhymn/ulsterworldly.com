quote = """As indicated by the title of this book, it is a Biblical, not a critical commentary on Isaiah. As such it is written from the view point of a minister of the gospel and missionary of the cross, who is particularly conscious of two scriptural commands to such a workman. The first one is, "Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth."" (2 Tim. 2:15). The second command, found in the same epistle. Is simply this, "Preach the word." (2 Tim. 4:2a)."""
