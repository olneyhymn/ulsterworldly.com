Sometimes it causes new denominations to startâ€”and there are many such groups in process of formation today. Let us not be too critical of them. They may have rediscovered the Gospel in the Bible, while we let dust gather on ours and allow the light of the Gospel to grow dim and cold and flicker out in our lives, and in our churches."""
