quote = """This blind loyalty to a clan is often transferred to a political leader or a party or faction in the government, in education, in business, in the church, and elsewhere. Clan loyalty may not be entirely to blame for the tendency of Korean society to fragment, but it certainly has its share. It often seems that all of Korean society from kindergarten to the National Assembly is engrossed in the 24 hour a day passion to build up the position and influence of "my faction" against the "opposition." It is often becomes axiomatic that "my leader can do no wrong." Principles are not what matters; position is paramount."""
