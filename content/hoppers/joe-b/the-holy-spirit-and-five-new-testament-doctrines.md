quote = """The more Christians grow and are united in this fellowship the less are they drawn to fellowship with the world and the unfruitful works of darkness. Just as a major task of the Spirit is to sanctify the individual Christian, so He also strives to purify the Church. Just as the life in the Spirit enables us to destroy the desires that war in our members, integrating our lives into one living organism, building it as one structure, the temple of the Spirit, so the Spirit operates in the Church to bring unity of thought and desire and purpose under the Lordship of Christ."""
