quote = """God is well-pleased with unselfish praying. There is the hungry friend of mine in Korea, physically hungry, spiritually hungry. As Jesus saw the hungry multitudes He said to His disciples, "Give ye them to eat." As He went about the cities and villages in Palestine the eye of Jesus saw the multitudes distressed and scattered as sheep not having a shepherd. The heart of Jesus was moved with compassion, the voice of Jesus called for intercessory-praying as He said, "The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few, Pray ye, therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that He send forth laborers, into harvest."
