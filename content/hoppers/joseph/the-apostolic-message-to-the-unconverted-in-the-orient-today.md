quote = """It is our firm conviction that the apostolic message, about which we have written in these pages is the final, absolute, and perfect message of God to sinful men, and that by it, and it alone, men of the Orient, and as well as of the Occident and other parts of the world, are being saved today. Christ Jesus, our hope, is the only hope for a lost world. "We have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Savior of the world." The present situation in the Orient, and the whole world, challenges us to renewed consecration, and that dominant passion of our lives to reach the unreached with this saving message."""
