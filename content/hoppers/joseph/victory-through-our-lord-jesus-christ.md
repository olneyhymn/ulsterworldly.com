quote = """A fundamental thought of the book, namely, the Second Coming of Christ, is given a final emphasis, the force of which we need to get. The Risen Lord here says, "Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to each man as his work is." In response to this repeated announcement the Spirit, the Bride, and the individual saint seem to join in the eager expectation and desire for his speedy return. Such an attitude as this must ever characterize the true church of Jesus Christ. """
