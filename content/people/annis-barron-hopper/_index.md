<span class="lead">Annis Barron Hopper (1893-1979) was born in York County, SC into an Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church family. Annis attended [Winthrop Normal College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winthrop_University) and taught for two years (1914, 1915) in Rowland, NC before traveling to New York City to attend the [Bible Teachersâ€™ Training School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Theological_Seminary) in preparation to serve the United Presbyterian Mission in Egypt. Her plans were interrupted when she married [Joseph Hopper](https://ulsterworldly.com/people/joseph-hopper/) in 1919; a few months after their marriage, they moved to [Mokpo, Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokpo,_Korea "Wikipedia Entry: Mokpo - Wikipedia") as PCUS missionaries.

She is buried in the [Laurelwood Cemetery in Rock Hill, SC](https://findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi/http%22/http/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=42636490).
